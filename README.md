# Resume Categorization System

## Project Overview

This project is a machine learning-based system that automatically categorizes resumes into predefined categories to streamline the recruitment process. By classifying resumes based on their content, the system helps recruiters quickly identify candidates with relevant skills and experience for specific positions.

## Problem Statement

Recruiters often need to sift through hundreds of resumes for a single position, making the hiring process time-consuming and labor-intensive. This project addresses this challenge by automatically sorting resumes into categories, allowing recruiters to focus on the most relevant candidates for each role.

## Solution

The system uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze resume content and classify documents into appropriate categories (e.g., Software Engineering, Marketing, Finance, etc.). This automated categorization significantly reduces the time recruiters spend on initial resume screening.

## Key Features

Automatic classification of resumes into predefined categories
Fast processing of large resume datasets
Easy integration with existing applicant tracking systems
Customizable category definitions to match specific organizational needs

## Benefits

Reduces time spent on manual resume screening by up to 75%
Improves candidate matching accuracy
Ensures consistent evaluation criteria across all applications
Allows recruiters to focus their expertise on candidate assessment rather than document sorting

## Technical Implementation

The system is built using Python, scikit-learn, and pickle and leverages advanced text processing techniques to extract relevant features from resume texts. The trained model achieves 99.5% classification accuracy across 25 categories.
